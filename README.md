EngSpecLatex
============

This is a framework for creating Architectural and Engineering Specifications in Latex

This has been licensed under the GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3.

The intent of this framework is to use it with ShareLatex (https://github.com/sharelatex) but it should work with many latex implementations. Development is slow and ongoing, lots of cleanup still needs to happen. If you use this and like it or have comments and suggestings, please let me know.
